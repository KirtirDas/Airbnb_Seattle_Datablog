matplotlib
csv
2. Project Motivation
My motivation was to analyze the data of Airbnb accommodation information in Seattle as homeowner. So, I tried to aimed on how to get maximum revenue in parallel with providing decent stay experience to guests. Based on my provisions, the 3 questions are as mentioned below:

a) Prediction on what might stimulates higher ratings?
b) What is the most popular time of the year for rentals of Seattle homes and which are most preferred areas?
c) When and what are the highest revenue-generating times of the year for Seattle home-owners?

3.File Descriptions
Created Project in Jupyter notebook: airbnb_seattle_Project2.ipnyb
